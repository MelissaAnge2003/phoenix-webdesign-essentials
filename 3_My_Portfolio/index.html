    <p>Welcome! I am currently designing and building my personal IT portfolio. This space will soon display my projects, skills, and experiments in web design and coding.</p>
    <p>Please check back in January to explore the finished version of my portfolio. Your patience is appreciated while I work on making it both functional and visually appealing.</p>
